# Gold-Price-Trends-via-Machine-Learning
To predict gold prices, follow these steps:

Data Collection: Gather historical gold prices, economic indicators (like inflation, interest rates), currency exchange rates, and data on global events that affect gold.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and scale it. Create new features that could help predict prices, like moving averages or volatility indicators.

Explore the Data: Visualize the data to identify trends and patterns that influence gold prices.

Choose a Model: Select a model for prediction, such as time series models (ARIMA), regression models, or machine learning models like random forests or LSTM.

Train the Model: Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training data and tune it for better performance.

Evaluate the Model: Check the model's accuracy using metrics like MAE or RMSE, and test it on unseen data.

Make Predictions: Use the trained model to predict future gold prices and compare the predictions with actual prices.

Deploy the Model (optional): Set up a system for real-time predictions and monitor the model's performance.
